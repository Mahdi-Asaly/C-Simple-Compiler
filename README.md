# C_Simple_Compiler
CSC is a compiler for the C programming language that created with lex and yacc and it is my compiler design course project :) 
In archlinux simply install byacc and use it for creating y.tab.c and lex for creating y.lex.c

for installing byacc : 
sudo pacman -S byacc #in ArchLinux usually lex is installed on your system 
sudo apt-get install byacc lex #in Ubuntu


NOTE: Tested on linux 16.04 with no errors , it's working also on Windows OS
